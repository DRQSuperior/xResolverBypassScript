🔒🔄 Bypass Ads and Cooldown with Proxies on xresolver.com 🔥

This Python script allows you to bypass annoying ads and cooldown restrictions on xresolver.com by leveraging the power of proxies. 🚀

📜 Description:
The script automates the process of sending POST requests to xresolver.com without being interrupted by ads and cooldown periods. By utilizing random HTTP proxies, the script ensures that requests originate from different IP addresses, enhancing anonymity and potentially circumventing blocking measures.

💻 Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the script from the repository.
3. Create a `proxies.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
4. Add a list of HTTP proxies (one per line) to the `proxies.txt` file. You can obtain proxies from trusted sources or APIs.
5. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
6. Enter the gamertag when prompted.
7. Sit back and let the script handle the rest!

⚠️ Note:
- The script bypasses ads and cooldown on xresolver.com by sending requests through different proxies, but it cannot guarantee uninterrupted access or success in all cases.
- It is recommended to use reputable proxy services or APIs for better performance, stability, and security.
